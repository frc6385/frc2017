# RobotCode 2017
### for FIRST Robotics Competition

The RobotCode is written in C# with RobotDotNet.

*It is said that non-command-based programming will make network connection slow, so I turned back to use the Command-based Programming.*

*The repository is cloned from our internal git repo, so we will NOT keep updating after FRC 2017 Shenzhen Regional finished.*

TrueMoe 2017.
